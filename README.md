# Inflation Forecasting using ARIMA, Random Forest, and SVM

This project focuses on forecasting inflation using three different machine learning and statistical models: **ARIMA**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. 
The goal is to compare their performance and determine which method yields better forecasting accuracy for inflation data.


## ðŸ“Š Models Used

- **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average for time series forecasting.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning method for regression.
- **SVM**: Support Vector Regression for high-dimensional modeling.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Forecast future inflation values.
- Compare accuracy of statistical (ARIMA) vs ML (RF, SVM) models.
- Visualize forecasted vs actual data.


## ðŸ“Œ Technologies
- R
- statsmodels (for ARIMA)
